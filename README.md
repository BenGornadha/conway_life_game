# conway_life_game

My own implementation of famous Conway's Game of life. 

In this example, I use a two-dimensional world. 
I tried to respect as much as possible SOLID principles, I know it's not perfect yet but at this very moment this is what I can do and I know that in some years I won't be as proud as I am right now ðŸ˜„
